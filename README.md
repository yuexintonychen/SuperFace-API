## SuperFace API

The SuperFace API uses TensorFlow, Keras and OpenCV and utilizes a wide range of machine learning techniques to implement multiple face recognition and object detection APIs. Each API can be easily deployed on a server and accessed by any device with the corresponding protocol. The Andriod demo App (in the "App" directory) integrates all currently built APIs and is available for use right away. Developers may also build additional new APIs and add them to this collection. Please refer to the documentation for running and building the source code.
